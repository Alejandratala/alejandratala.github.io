As a normal person who doesn't know much about electronics, one thinks of the cloud, and just thinks it's a convenient service to have access to your "stuff" anywhere you want. So in theory you could take a picture on your camera and use `Google Drive` and be able to access it on your laptop/computer/mobile or log-in to your account at the school's computer and have access to it. But in all honestly is that all? in this blog I will be discussing the different things I found out while I did some reading, also what different services there are out there and how much they would cost to have lets say a simple website with a database.


## What is the Cloud

Cloud could be looked as a multiple of services being stored somewhere else and you as a costumer choose a service you want and get access to those services, so you don't have to have it on your computer you can have it online. There are many servies: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS... but what do those abreviations mean? 

### IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service, here is where you grab somethings from the service like the basics in order to build a website, but you have to write the code and structure the final product. So you can use the cloud's storage, the operating systems, but you have to know how to use them and build your application yourself.

### PaaS

Platform as a Service, its a ready to use platform for your code, so you get a set of tools in order to add your code and you just decorate it but all the big things are there, you don't have to worry about adding a check out/credit card handling on your webshop because the code will be there. You however still have the responsability to tweek and change things as time passes by 

### SaaS

Software as a service, this is a ready and done deal, so a good example would be Square space, you go in and choose what you want, you as a costumer aren't required to write or know about code, you just buy the finish product. Another good example would be Office 365.

## What are the pros and cons of using Cloud services?

| Pros             | Cons         |

| Good collaboration between workers | The need of being online/having internet |
| Easily accessible | Data loss or theft |
| Low maintanance cost |  data being leaked |
| Back-up and restore data becoming easy |  |
